🎯 Guess The Number – Java Console Game
📝 Project Overview
This is a console-based Java game where the player must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. The game offers hints after each guess, such as whether the guessed number is too high or too low. It also displays all previous guesses and remaining attempts, and prompts the user to play again after each round.
This project was developed as Task 2 of my Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

💡 Features
✅ Random number generation between 1–100

✅ Input validation for out-of-range or non-integer input

✅ Displays helpful hints ("Too high" / "Too low")

✅ Tracks and displays previous guesses

✅ Displays remaining attempts

✅ Option to play again after finishing a round

✅ Clean, object-oriented design using a separate Game class
